# RoadDamagedetection

Abstract:
The Road Damage Detector is an image processing project designed to detect and classify various types of damage to roads and pavements. The project involves developing a machine learning algorithm that can accurately identify different types of road damage, including cracks, potholes, and other types of deterioration.The system will take images of roads captured by cameras mounted on vehicles or drones and use computer vision techniques to analyze the images and identify areas of damage. The system will then classify the type and severity of the damage and provide this information to road maintenance teams for repair and maintenance planning.The system will also incorporate real-time data from sensors mounted on vehicles and drones to enhance the accuracy of the detection and classification process.The Road Damage Detector project has the potential to improve road safety, reduce vehicle damage, and save maintenance costs for road infrastructure.

Challenges:
-> Data collection: Collecting high-quality images and videos of roads with different types of damage can be challenging, as you need to cover a wide range of road conditions and weather conditions. You may need to rely on public datasets or create your dataset by capturing images and videos yourself.

-> Model selection: Choosing the right model architecture and tuning the hyperparameters can be a challenging task, as different models perform differently on different types of data. You may need to experiment with different models and hyperparameters to find the best combination.

-> Real-world deployment: Deploying the model in the real world can present several challenges, such as dealing with real-time data streams, ensuring the model's reliability and robustness, and integrating the system with existing infrastructure.

Use if this project:
-> Improve road safety: By detecting and identifying road damage in real-time, the system can alert drivers and authorities to potential hazards, reducing the risk of accidents and injuries.

-> Reduce maintenance costs: By detecting and repairing damage early, before it becomes more extensive, the system can help to reduce the overall cost of road maintenance.

-> Enhance road network management: The data collected by the system can be used to create a detailed map of road conditions, allowing authorities to prioritize repairs and allocate resources more efficiently.

-> Increase efficiency: By automating the process of road damage detection, the system can save time and reduce the need for manual inspections.

This script uses a pre-trained SSD MobileNet model for object detection on images. The model is trained to detect 8 different classes of road damages including D00, D01, D10, D11, D20, D40, D43.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
OpenCV
Numpy
PIL
Matplotlib

Usage:
- Set the paths to the frozen detection graph and the label map file in the PATH_TO_CKPT and PATH_TO_LABELS variables respectively.
- Set the NUM_CLASSES variable to the number of classes in your label map.
- Set the path to the directory containing test images in the PATH_TO_TEST_IMAGES_DIR variable.
- Set the list of damage types in the D_TYPE variable.
- Set the list of government codes in the govs variable.
- Run the script.
